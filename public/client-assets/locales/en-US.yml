  step2_1: "Let's finish setting up your profile before writing a note or following anyone."
  step2_2: "Providing some information about who you are will make it easier for others to tell if they want to see your notes or follow you."
  step3_1: "Finished setting up your profile?"
  step3_2: "Then let's try posting a note next. You can do so by pressing the button with a pencil icon on the screen."
  step3_3: "Fill in the modal and press the button on the top right to post."
  step3_4: "Have nothing to say? Try \"just setting up my msky\"!"
  step4_1: "Finished posting your first note?"
  step4_2: "Hurray! Now your first note should be displayed on your timeline."
  step5_1: "Now, let's try making your timeline more lively by following other people."
  step5_2: "{featured} will show you popular notes in this instance. {explore} will let you find popular users. Try finding people you'd like to follow there!"
  step5_3: "To follow other users, click on their icon and press the \"Follow\" button on their profile."
  step5_4: "If the other user has a lock icon next to their name, it may take some time for that user to manually approve your follow request."
  step6_1: "You should be able to see other users' notes on your timeline now."
  step6_2: "You can also put \"reactions\" on other people's notes to quickly respond to them."
  step6_3: "To attach a \"reaction\", press the \"+\" mark on another user's note and choose an emoji you'd like to react with."
  step7_1: "Congratulations! You have now finished Misskey's basic tutorial."
